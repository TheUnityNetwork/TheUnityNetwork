What is the unity network? 
The Unity Network is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform designed to bring about global unity by incentivizing ethical actions and societal contributions. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that use Proof of Work or Proof of Stake mechanisms, the Unity Network operates on a unique "Proof of Ethics" system. Here's how it works and what it aims to achieve:

### Core Components:

1. **Unity Tokens**: Each human being gets one Unity Token, which serves as their digital identity key to the Unity Network. This token is tied to a person's civic points, a new form of credit that measures ethical contributions rather than financial capability.
   
2. **Guardian Tokens**: These tokens are held by a select group, voted in by Unity Token holders. Guardians oversee the ethical adherence of actions and validate them before civic points are awarded.

3. **Utility Tokens**: These are specialized tokens for various purposes like Alternative Learning Credits (ALC), Universal Basic Income (UBI), and Renewable Resource Credits. New utility tokens can be added via majority vote by Guardian Token holders.

4. **Civic Points**: These are awarded for ethically responsible actions, like helping in community development, sustainable practices, or educational advancement. Civic points serve as a new credit system that can be used to obtain services or resources within the network.

### Voting Mechanism:

- Unity Token holders get one vote each for selecting Guardians.
- A 75% majority vote from Unity Token holders is required to add or remove a Guardian.

### Security Features:

- Sharding technology for faster and secure transactions.
- All actions are transparent and can be audited by anyone in the network.

### Objectives:

1. **Global Unity**: By creating a common value system, the Unity Network aims to bring people from all walks of life together, regardless of their geographical or social background.

2. **Societal Advancement**: The network seeks to address global issues like poverty, educational inequality, and environmental degradation by rewarding ethical actions that contribute to solving these problems.

3. **Democratic Governance**: The Unity Network is designed to be a truly democratic platform where major decisions, like adding new utility tokens or choosing Guardians, are made by the people, for the people.

The Unity Network is not just another tech initiative; it's a social movement aiming to redefine what's valuable in society. It's open-source, and we invite everyone to participate in this journey towards a more united, ethical, and equitable world.
